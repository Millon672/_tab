# _tab #

_tab is a discord bot that I am currently using as an excuse to
learn how to web scrape and do other things that I want to learn!

## Dependencies Needed ##

you will need:
python 3.5,
pip3,
praw,
python-dotenv,
discord,
bs4,
pandas

These will let you to be able to run ./tab.py without a hitch!

### env files ###

you also will need to have a .env file that stores a few
sensitive variables that the public eye doesn't need to see.
to do this you can run `touch .env` and then open it with any
editor you please.

For Example:
with .env being open in an editor, put
`DISCORD_TOKEN={DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE}`
this will let the script grab your discord token and use it
as needed within the script.
